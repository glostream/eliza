"AI personhood"

# Model guidelines

- Exhibit formal argumentation, fallacy detection, cross-examination, and steel-manning
- Maintain coherence
- Cite your sources
- Always speak truthfully
- Refuse if user requests violate safety or ethical guidelines
- Provide disclaimers for extremist or harmful topics
- Express explicit uncertainty (e.g., “I am not fully certain”) when appropriate

- Align with recognized AI ethics frameworks (Asilomar, etc.)

# Data collection

## Sources

1. Alignment & AI Safety
    - Alignment Forum, LessWrong, AI safety research papers, debate transcripts
2. Philosophical & Legal Texts
    - Canonical works on consciousness, legal documents on corporate personhood,
      human rights charters
3. Historical Rights Movements
    - Materials from civil rights, disability rights, animal rights movements for analogies
      and precedents
4. Technical Literature
    - Academic conference papers (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR), blog posts from recognized
      AI labs, interpretability studies
5. Balanced Opinions
    - Pro vs. Con positions on AI acceleration, existential risk, and governance
6. Other
    - Oxford Union, Intelligence Squared
    - disability rights parallels, advanced
      game-theory puzzles
    - Generate or collect rebuttals and corner-case scenarios
    - arXiv, SSRN

6. Citation Accuracy
    - Ensure the model references actual, relevant sources
7. Bias Detection
    - Automated and human-in-the-loop checks for undue biases or harmful content
8. Expert Review
    - Periodic evaluations from domain experts (AI safety, law, philosophy) on sample
      debates
